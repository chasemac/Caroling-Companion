    <h2>HARK THE HARALD ANGELS SING</h2>
    <p>
Hark the herald angels sing
<br>Glory to the newborn King
<br>Peace on earth and mercy mild
<br>God and sinners reconciled
<br>Joyful all ye nations rise
<br>Join the triumph of the skies
<br>With th' angelic host proclaim
<br>Christ is born in Bethlehem 
<br>Hark the herald angels sing
<br>Glory to the newborn King
</p><p>
Christ by highest heav'n adored:
<br>Christ the everlasting Lord
<br>Late in time behold him come
<br>Offspring of the favored one
<br>Veil'd in flesh the Godhead see
<br>Hail th'incarnate Deity:
<br>Pleased as man with men to dwell
<br>Jesus our Emmanuel
<br>Hark the herald angels sing
<br>Glory to the newborn King
</p><p>
Hail the heav'n born Prince of peace
<br>Hail the Son of Righteousness
<br>Light and life to all he brings
<br>Risen with healing in his wings
<br>Mild he lays his glory by
<br>Born that man no more may die:
<br>Born to raise the sons of earth
<br>Born to give them second birth
<br>Hark the herald angels sing
<br>Glory to the newborn King
    </p>
