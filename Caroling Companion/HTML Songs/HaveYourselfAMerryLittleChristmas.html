    <h2>HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS</h2>
<p>
    Have yourself a merry little Christmas
<br>Let your heart be light
<br>From now on
<br>our troubles will be out of sight 
<br>Have yourself a merry little Christmas
<br>Make the Yule-tide gay 
<br>From now on 
<br>our troubles will be miles away
</p><p>
Here were are as in olden days
<br>happy golden days of yore
<br>Faithful friends who are dear to us
<br>gather near to us once more
</p><p>
Through the years we all will be together
<br>If the Fates allow
<br>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
<br>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
    </p>
