        <h2>AWAY IN A MANGER</h2>
        <p>
        Away in a manger no crib for a bed
        <br>The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
        </p><p>
        The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
        <br>The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay
        </p><p>
        The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
        <br>But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
        </p><p>
        I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
        <br>And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh
        </p><p>
        Be near me Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay
        <br>Close by me forever and love me I pray
        </p><p>
        Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
        <br>And take us to heaven to live with Thee there
        </p>
