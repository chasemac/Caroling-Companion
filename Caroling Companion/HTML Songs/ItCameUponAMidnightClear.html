    <h2>IT CAME UPON THE MIDNIGHT CLEAR</h2>
    <p>
It came upon the midnight clear
<br>That glorious song of old
<br>From angels bending near the earth
<br>To touch their harps of gold
<br>Peace on the earth good will to men
<br>From heaven's all gracious King
<br>The world in solemn stillness lay
<br>To hear the angels sing
</p><p>
Still through the cloven skies they come
<br>With peaceful wings unfurled
<br>And still their heavenly music floats
<br>O'er all the weary world
<br>Above its sad and lowly plains
<br>They bend on hovering wing
<br>And ever o'er its Babel sounds
<br>The blessed angels sing
</p><p>
Yet with te woes of sin and strife
<br>The world hath suffered long
<br>Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
<br>Two thousand years of wrong
<br>And man at war with man hears not
<br>The love song which they bring:
<br>O hush the noise ye men of strife
<br>And hear the angels sing
</p><p>
For lo the days are hastening on
<br>By prophet bards foretold
<br>When with the ever-circling years
<br>Shall come the Age of Gold
<br>When peace shall over all the earth
<br>Its ancient splendors fling
<br>And all the world give back the song
<br>Which now the angels sing
    </p>
