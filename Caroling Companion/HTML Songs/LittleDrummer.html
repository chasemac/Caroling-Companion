    <h2>LITTLE DRUMMER BOY</h2>
    <p>

(RPPP = "rum pum pum pum")
</p><p>
Come they told me
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>A new born King to see
</p><p>
Our finest gifts we bring
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>To lay before the king
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>RPPP
<br>RPPP 
</p><p>
So to honor Him
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>When we come
</p><p><p>
Little baby
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>I am a poor boy too
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>I have no gift to bring
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>That's fit to give our King
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>RPPP
<br>RPPP
</p><p>
Shall I play for you
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>On my drum
</p><p>
Mary nodded
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>The ox and lamb kept time
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>I played my drum for Him
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>I played my best for Him
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>RPPP
<br>RPPP
</p><p>
Then He smiled at me
<br>Pa RPPP
<br>Me and my drum
