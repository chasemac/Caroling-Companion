    <h2>FROSTY THE SNOWMAN</h2>
    <p>
Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul
<br>With a corn cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made of coal
</p><p>
Frosty the Snowman is a fairytale they say
<br>He was made of snow but the children know he came to life one day
</p><p>
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
<br>For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
</p><p>
Oh Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be
<br>and the children say he could laugh and play
<br>just the same as you and me
</p><p>
Thumpety thump thump thumpety thump thump
<br>look at Frosty go
</p><p>
Thumpety thump thump thumpety thump thump
<br>over the hills of snow
</p><p>
Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
<br>so he said "Let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away"
</p><p>
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
<br>Running here and there all around the square 
<br>sayin' "Catch me if you can"
</p><p>
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
<br>and only paused a moment when he heard him holler "Stop"
</p><p>
For Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
<br>But he waved goodbye sayin'
<br>"Don't cry I'll be back again some day"
    </p>
