    <h2>THE FIRST NOEL</h2>
    <p>
The First Noel the angel did say
<br>Was to certain poor shepherds
<br>in fields as they lay
<br>In fields as they lay keeping their sheep
<br>On a cold winter's night that was so deep
</p><p>
Noel Noel Noel Noel
<br>Born is the King of Israel
</p><p>
They looked up and saw a star
<br>Shining in the east beyond them far
<br>And to the earth it gave great light
<br>And so it continued both day and night
</p><p>
And by the light of that same star
<br>Three wise men came from country far
<br>To seek for a king was their intent
<br>And to follow the star wherever it went
</p><p>
This star drew nigh to the northwest
<br>O'er Bethlehem it took it rest
<br>And there it did both stop and stay
<br>Right over the place where Jesus lay
</p><p>
Then entered in those wise men three
<br>Full reverently upon their knee
<br>and offered there in his presence
<br>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense
</p><p>
Then let us all with one accord
<br>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
<br>That hath made heaven and earth of naught
<br>And with his blood mankind hath bought
    </p>
