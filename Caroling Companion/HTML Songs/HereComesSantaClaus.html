    <p>
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus 
<br>Right down Santa Claus lane
<br>Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
<br>Pullin' on the reins
<br>Bells are ringin' children singin'
<br>All is merry and bright
<br>Hang your stockings and say your prayers
<br>'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight 
</p><p>
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus 
<br>Right down Santa Claus lane
<br>He's got a bag that's filled with toys
<br>For boys and girls again
<br>Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle 
<br>Oh what a beautiful sight`
<br>So jump in bed and cover your head
<br>'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight 
</p><p>
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus 
<br>Right down Santa Claus lane
<br>He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
<br>He loves you just the same
<br>Santa Claus knows we're all Gods children
<br>That makes everything right
<br>So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
<br>'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight 
</p><p>
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus 
<br>Right down Santa Claus lane
<br>He'll come around when the chimes ring out
<br>That it's Christmas morn again
<br>Peace on earth will come to all
<br>If we just follow the light
<br>So lets give thanks to the lord above
<br>That Santa Claus comes tonight
    </p>
