    <h2>WINTER WONDERLAND</h2>
    <p>
Sleigh bells ring
<br>are you listening
<br>in the lane
<br>snow is glistening
<br>A beautiful sight
<br>we're happy tonight
<br>walking in a winter wonderland
</p><p>
Gone away is the bluebird
<br>here to stay is a new bird
<br>He sings a love song
<br>as we go along
<br>walking in a winter wonderland
</p><p>
In the meadow we can build a snowman
<br>Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
<br>He'll say: Are you married?
<br>we'll say: No man
<br>But you can do the job
<br>when you're in town
</p><p>
Later on
<br>we'll conspire
<br>as we dream by the fire
<br>To face unafraid
<br>the plans that we've made
<br>walking in a winter wonderland
</p><p>
In the meadow we can build a snowman
<br>and pretend that he's a circus clown
<br>We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
<br>until the the other kids knock him down
</p><p>
When it snows
<br>ain't it thrilling
<br>Though your nose gets a chilling
<br>We'll frolic and play
<br>the Eskimo way
<br>walking in a winter wonderland
</p><p>
Walking in a winter wonderland
<br>walking in a winter wonderland
    </p>
