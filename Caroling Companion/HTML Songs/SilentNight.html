    <h2>SILENT NIGHT</h2>
    <p>
Silent night holy night
<br>All is calm all is bright
<br>Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
<br>Holy infant so tender and mild
<br>Sleep in heavenly peace
<br>Sleep in heavenly peace
</p><p>
Silent night holy night
<br>Shepherds quake at the sight
<br>Glories stream from heaven afar
<br>Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
<br>Christ the Savior is born
<br>Christ the Savior is born
</p><p>
Silent night holy night
<br>Son of God love's pure light
<br>Radiant beams from Thy holy face
<br>With dawn of redeeming grace
<br>Jesus Lord at Thy birth
<br>Jesus Lord at Thy birth
    </p>
