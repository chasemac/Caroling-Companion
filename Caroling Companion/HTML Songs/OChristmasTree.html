    <h2>O CHRISTMAS TREE</h2>
    <p>
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>How are thy leaves so verdant
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>How are thy leaves so verdant
</p><p>
Not only in the summertime
<br>But even in winter is thy prime
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>How are thy leaves so verdant
</p><p>
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Much pleasure doth thou bring me
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Much pleasure doth thou bring me
</p><p>
For every year the Christmas tree
<br>Brings to us all both joy and glee
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Much pleasure doth thou bring me
</p><p>
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Thy candles shine out brightly
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Thy candles shine out brightly
</p><p>
Each bough doth hold its tiny light
<br>That makes each toy to sparkle bright
<br>O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
<br>Thy candles shine out brightly
    </p>
