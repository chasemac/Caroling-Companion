    <h2>SILVER BELLS</h2>
    <p>
City sidewalks busy sidewalks
<br>Dressed in holiday style
<br>In the air
<br>There's a feeling
<br>of Christmas
<br>Children laughing
<br>People passing
<br>Meeting smile after smile
<br>and on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells silver bells
<br>It's Christmas time in the city
<br>Ring-a-ling hear them sing
<br>Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
<br>Even stop lights
<br>Blink a bright red and green
<br>As the shoppers rush
<br>home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
<br>See the kids bunch
<br>This is Santa's big scene
<br>And above all this bustle
<br>You'll hear

Silver bells silver bells
<br>It's Christmas time in the city
<br>Ring-a-ling hear them sing
<br>Soon it will be Christmas day
