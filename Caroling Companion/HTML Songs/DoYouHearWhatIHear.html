    <h2>DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR?</h2>
    <p>
        <br>Said the night wind to the little lamb
        <br>do you see what I see
        <br>Way up in the sky little lamb
        <br>do you see what I see
        <br>A star a star dancing in the night
        <br>With a tail as big as a kite (x2)
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
        <br>do you hear what I hear
        <br>Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
        <br>do you hear what I hear
        <br>A song a song high above the trees
        <br>With a voice as big as the sea (x2)
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
        <br>do you know what I know
        <br>In your palace warm mighty king
        <br>do you know what I know
        <br>A Child a Child shivers in the cold
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Let us bring Him silver and gold (x2)
        <br>Said the king to the people everywhere
        <br>listen to what I say
        <br>Pray for peace people everywhere
        <br>listen to what I say
        <br>The Child the Child sleeping in the night
        <br>He will bring us goodness and light (x2)
    </p>
