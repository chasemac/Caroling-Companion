    <h2>JOY TO THE WORLD</h2>
    <p>
Joy to The world the Lord has come
<br>Let earth receive her King
<br>Let ev'ry heart prepare him room
<br>And heaven and nature sing (x3)

Joy to the world the Savior reigns
<br>Let men their songs employ
<br>While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
<br>Repeat the sounding joy (x3)

He rules the world with truth and grace
<br>And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness
<br>And wonders of His love (x2)
<br>And wonder wonders of His love
    </p>
