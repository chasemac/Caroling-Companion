    <h2>LET IT SNOW</h2>
    <p>
Oh the weather outside is frightful
<br>But the fire is so delightful
<br>And since we've no place to go
<br>Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow
</p><p>
It doesn't show signs of stopping
<br>And I've bought some corn for popping
<br>The lights are turned way down low
<br>Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow
</p><p>
When we finally kiss good night
<br>How I'll hate going out in the storm
<br>But if you'll really hold me tight
<br>All the way home I'll be warm
</p><p>
The fire is slowly dying
<br>And my dear we're still goodbying
<br>But as long as you love me so
<br>Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow
    </p>
