    <h2>JINGLE BELLS</h2>
    <p>
Dashing through the snow
<br>On a one horse open sleigh
<br>O'er the fields we go
<br>Laughing all the way
<br>Bells on bob tail ring
<br>making spirits bright
<br>What fun it is to laugh and sing
<br>A sleighing song tonight
</p><p>
Oh jingle bells jingle bells
<br>Jingle all the way
<br>Oh what fun it is to ride
<br>In a one horse open sleigh
<br>Jingle bells jingle bells
<br>Jingle all the way
<br>Oh what fun it is to ride
<br>In a one horse open sleigh
</p><p>
A day or two ago
<br>I thought I'd take a ride
<br>And soon Miss Fanny Bright
<br>Was seated by my side
<br>The horse was lean and lank
<br>Misfortune seemed his lot
<br>We got into a drifted bank
<br>And then we got upsot
</p><p>
CHORUS 
</p><p>
Now the ground is white
<br>Go it while you're young
<br>Take the girls tonight
<br>And sing this sleighing song
<br>Just get a bob tailed bay
<br>two-forty as his speed
<br>Hitch him to an open sleigh
<br>And crack you'll take the lead
</p><p>
CHORUS
    </p>
